## Question:

Given a list of strings, group the anagrams together. Return a list of lists where each inner list contains strings that are anagrams of each other.

## Example:

Input: ["cat", "Tac", "bat", "tap"]

Output: [["cat", "Tac"], ["bat", "tap"]]

## Hint:

Consider using a hashmap to store the frequency of letters in each word.
Use the frequency of letters as the key in the hashmap.
Iterate through the list of strings and group them based on their letter frequencies.
